# üîê Secure Login System (Python + SQLite)

A **secure and minimal CLI-based login system** built with Python and SQLite. It features **password hashing**, **TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, and a clean text-based UI ‚Äî ideal for learning or simple authentication prototypes.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üîê Secure password hashing with SHA-256 and unique salt
- üîë Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- üß± SQLite database for user data storage
- üìÇ Persistent login system with registration, login, logout
- üßæ Displays user details (ID, username, 2FA status)
- üí° Clean CLI interface for terminal use

You‚Äôre seeing formatting issues in GitHub's dark theme because:

* You're putting code block markers like ` ```bash ` inside a block that's already treated as code.
* You‚Äôre using `>` (block quote) instead of proper Markdown structure for lists and sections.

Here‚Äôs a **clean and properly formatted** version of the sections you can **copy-paste into your README.md** directly:

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gourab-0/secure-login-system.git
cd secure-login-system
````

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python secure_login.py
```

### 3. Follow the Menu

```
1. Register
2. Login
3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication
4. View Users
5. Logout
6. Exit
```

## üîê How 2FA Works

- The system generates a **Base32 secret key**
- Every 30 seconds, a new 6-digit TOTP code is calculated
- The code can be entered manually or scanned using apps like:
  - Google Authenticator
  - Authy
  - Microsoft Authenticator

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No third-party libraries ‚Äî pure Python standard modules only!
