# 🔐 Secure Login System (Python + SQLite)

A **secure and minimal CLI-based login system** built with Python and SQLite. It features **password hashing**, **TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, and a clean text-based UI — ideal for learning or simple authentication prototypes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Secure password hashing with SHA-256 and unique salt
- 🔑 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords)
- 🧱 SQLite database for user data storage
- 📂 Persistent login system with registration, login, logout
- 🧾 Displays user details (ID, username, 2FA status)
- 💡 Clean CLI interface for terminal use

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gourab-0/secure-login-system.git
cd secure-login-system

### 2. Run the Script
```bash
python secure_login.py

### 3. Follow the Menu

1. Register  
2. Login  
3. Enable Two-Factor Authentication  
4. View Users  
5. Logout  
6. Exit

---
###🔐 How 2FA Works
>The system generates a Base32 secret key
>Every 30 seconds, a new 6-digit TOTP code is calculated
>Can be entered manually or scanned using apps like:
    -Google Authenticator
    -Authy
    -Microsoft Authenticator

✅ Requirements
-Python 3.x
-No third-party libraries — pure Python standard modules only!
